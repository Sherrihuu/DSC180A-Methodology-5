## Brainstorming for Quarter 2 Project

### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
One of the most fascinating topics covered in my domain this quarter has been the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the early detection and management of sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes injury to its own tissues and organs. The integration of AI and ML algorithms with electronic health records (EHRs) enables the real-time analysis of vast amounts of patient data, such as vital signs, laboratory results, and clinical notes. This technological advancement holds the promise of identifying at-risk patients sooner than traditional methods, potentially reducing mortality rates and improving patient outcomes. The intersection of advanced technology and critical care medicine in this context is not only innovative but also has significant implications for public health."

### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate the effectiveness of a machine learning-based early warning system for sepsis in a clinical setting. It might involve developing a ML algorithm that analyzes real-time patient data from EHRs to predict the onset of sepsis. The investigation would compare the predictive accuracy and timeliness of the ML system against standard clinical assessment tools like the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. The primary goals would be to determine if the ML system can:

Improve Early Detection: Identify sepsis cases earlier than current methods to help patients to save money in ICU.
Enhance Patient Outcomes: Reduce morbidity and mortality associated with sepsis through timely interventions.

### **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
Instead of relying solely on historical data, I might explore the real-time data from patients admitted to the hospital during the study period. This approach would allow for the monitoring of patients' progress and the collection of time-sensitive variables that may not be accurately captured retrospectively. Additionally, talking more to interdisciplinary teams—including domain experts like nurses—could provide a more holistic understanding of the data and improve the applicability of the findings in clinical practice.

### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
Deep Learning Models: Utilizing neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, to handle time-series data from patient monitors. These models are capable of capturing temporal patterns that traditional models might miss and can help detect any abnormal situations in patient data.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Applying NLP techniques to extract valuable information from unstructured clinical notes and reports within EHRs. This approach can uncover critical insights about patient conditions that are not captured in structured data fields, enhancing the overall analysis and decision-making process.
